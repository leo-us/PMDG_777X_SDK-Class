# PMDG_777X_SDK Class
This file can be inserted into an MSFS managed code (C#) project to implement the PMDG 777X SDK.
It is somehow the alter ego of the <PMDG_777X_SDK.h> file used in unmanaged (C++) code, and marshals its non-blittable fields.

PMDG is providing the <PMDG_777X_SDK.h> header file for unmanaged code as part of the airplane documentation, but not for managed code.
Besides, I could not find this managed code 777X SDK file in GitHub or elsewhere.
That's why I decided to create it and share it.
I'm durrently using it for an MSFS PMDG 777-300ER client project I created, and it seems to be working as expected as is.

Any comment or suggestion for improvement or editing would be welcome.
